# Getting Started

## Starting ELK stack locally

The easiest way is to start ELK stack via `docker-compose`. You can use the following repo to get ELK up and running - [Elastic stack (ELK) on Docker](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk).

After initial setup is done - login to [Kibana](http://localhost:5601), then:
* navigate to [Management -> Ingest -> Logstash Pipelines](http://localhost:5601/app/management/ingest/pipelines/pipeline)
* hit `Create Pipeline` button
* in the `pipeline` window paste
```shell
input { 
    tcp {
        port => 50000
    }
}

output {
    elasticsearch {
        hosts => "elasticsearch:9200"
        user => "logstash_internal"
        password => "changeme"
    }
}
```
* restart the stack
* start the app
* open [Kibana](http://localhost:5601) and navigate to [Analytics -> Discover](http://localhost:5601/app/discover)
* observe the logs from the app
